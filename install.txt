Thank you for downloading Essenger: The better Messenger (TM)

Essenger requires some dependencies that you may need to install, listed below.
If your system does not have one or more of the following
packages, please use `opam install <package>`. Please note that 
it is important to download the packages in the order they are listed, 
especially the packages listed after str. 

Essenger requires the following OCaml packages: 
  yojson
  ANSITerminal
  unix
  sha
  str
  ssl
  lwt_ssl
  cohttp
  cohttp-lwt
  cohttp-lwt-unix 

If you are running on WSL and run into an ssl or tls error, run the following
two commands: 
  `sudo apt-get install pkg-config`
  `sudo apt-get install libssl-dev`

If you are on MacOS and run into an ssl or tls error, use the 3110 virtual
environment, since it provides a clean OCaml environment, and download the
previous packages. 

Once you have downloaded the required packages, run `make essenger` to run
Essenger. Please ignore the warnings. Have fun chatting!

If you are looking around in server.ml please ignore the red squigglies. 
We think the merlin file doesn't recognize the cohttp-lwt-unix package
yet the program runs perfectly fine.
